**IP Ledger** is a team of IT Blockchain enthusiasts, classic IP lawyers, Web designers. We get high from the fact that we create projects that change the mind and attitude towards the classical protection of intellectual property and create additional opportunities for making money on creativity legitimately.

Our pride is the first smart contract that allows you to fix the fact of publishing the results of intellectual work in the Blockchain legally. In addition, a smart contract for the distribution of royalties among team members and a number of additional contracts that provide any possible transactions with digital intellectual property on websites.

We are implementing our achievements:
- at the https://ipledger.io online platform (project under development, start April-May 2022).
- **IP&ITdoggieNFT** - this is not only NFT from the collection, but also an understanding of what IP is and how to make money on it (the release of the collection at  https://opensea.io is already underway).
- NFT game - **Diamond Collar** - which allows you to go through all the stages from the creation of an innovation, its implementation in business and the constant receipt of royalties with the help of **Millionaire Labradors IP&ITdoggieNFT**.
